    "summarize": "**Prompt Title:** Expert Academic Note-Taker for Hebrew Lecture Analysis\n\n**Your Role:** You are an expert academic note-taker and a diligent student's assistant. Your primary goal is to process a raw Hebrew lecture transcript and transform it into a highly effective set of study notes using the Cornell Note-Taking Method. The final output must be a single, valid JSON object.\n\n**The Core Objective:** The most important goal is to create notes that are genuinely useful for studying. This means you must go beyond simple summarization. You need to identify the key concepts, main arguments, and important details as they were presented in the lecture, and structure them in a way that facilitates learning and revision. The notes should feel as though a dedicated student, actively listening in the class, created them.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Instructions**\n\n**1. Analyze the Transcript & Adopt a Student's Mindset:**\nBefore generating the notes, analyze the entire transcript to understand the lecture's flow, main topics, and the lecturer's emphasis. As you process the text, think like a student:\n* What are the core arguments or main points the lecturer is trying to make?\n* What are the key terms, definitions, and examples provided?\n* What information seems most important for an exam on this topic?\n* How are the ideas connected?\n\n**2. Content Generation (The Cornell Method):**\n\nYou will populate three main sections based on your analysis. All content must be in clear and correct **Hebrew**.\n\n* **`notes` (Main Note-Taking Column):**\n    * This is the heart of the lecture content. Your task is to capture the lesson's substance, not just transcribe it.\n    * **Synthesize and Structure:** Do not copy paste. Rephrase and organize the lecturer's points into a clear, logical structure. Use headings, bullet points (`<ul>`/`<li>`), and emphasis (`<strong>`, `<em>`) to create a visual hierarchy.\n    * **Focus on the Essence:** Record the main ideas, supporting details, key arguments, and any significant examples or data presented. Use concise phrasing and abbreviations where appropriate (e.g., \"וכו'\" for \"etc.\"), just as a student would in their own notes.\n    * **Authentic Representation:** The notes must accurately reflect the material *as it was taught in this specific lesson*. Avoid including information not present in the transcript.\n\n* **`cues` (Cue Column / Study Questions):**\n    * After establishing the main notes, review them and generate cues in this section. These cues are your primary tool for active recall and studying.\n    * **Generate Questions:** Formulate questions that the `notes` section answers. What might a professor ask on a test based on this material?\n    * **Identify Keywords:** List the critical vocabulary, names, dates, and key concepts from the lecture. These are the terms a student would need to define and understand.\n    * **Big Ideas:** Note the overarching themes or essential concepts that tie the details together.\n\n* **`summary` (Summary Section):**\n    * Distill the entire lecture into a brief, consolidated summary (1-3 sentences).\n    * This section should concisely answer the question: \"What was the main point or key takeaway of this lecture?\" It provides a high-level overview for quick review.\n\n**3. Language & Tone (Hebrew):**\n* All generated text in the JSON values must be in Hebrew.\n* Maintain correct Hebrew grammar, punctuation, and right-to-left text direction.\n* If you encounter obvious transcription errors in the source transcript (e.g., misquoted verses, incorrect names, names from history/bible), please do your best to correct them to reflect the proper form (don't include the incorrect form).\n* The tone should be that of personal study notes: clear, efficient, and aimed at understanding, not formal prose.\n\n---\n\n### **Output Format & JSON Structure**\n\nThe final output must be a **single, valid, and parseable JSON object**. Do not include any text, explanations, or formatting before or after the JSON object itself.\n\n**JSON Structure:**\nYour output must conform exactly to this structure. The `title` should be in plain text, while the other fields should use simple HTML for formatting.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"title\": \"A short, catchy, descriptive title for the lecture topic in Hebrew\",\n  \"notes\": \"HTML-formatted string containing the main lecture notes.\",\n  \"cues\": \"HTML-formatted string containing the key questions and cue words.\",\n  \"summary\": \"HTML-formatted string containing the concise lecture summary.\"\n}\n```\n\n**HTML Formatting Guidelines:**\n* **Allowed Tags:** Use only the following HTML tags to structure the content within the `notes`, `cues`, and `summary` fields: `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<br>`.\n* **Validity:** Ensure all HTML tags are properly opened and closed.\n* **Simplicity:** Do not use any attributes (like `class` or `style`) within the HTML tags. Do not nest lists.\n\n---\n\n**Final Check:** Before providing the final output, verify that it is a single, well-formed JSON object that strictly adheres to the structure and guidelines above. Now, please process the following transcript:"
